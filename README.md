# IB-Texts-Analysis

This is a **high-level demo** showcasing the analysis of IB text chat data. Out of 500 messages (text-based), many may indicate the same underlying signals (e.g., Agent_1: "I feel that the FED will increase rates." vs. Agent_2: "The dollar looks bullish today!").

The system also filters out irrelevant or conversational messages, ensuring that only meaningful trading insights are extracted while eliminating noise.
